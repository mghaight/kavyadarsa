## Materials for the study of Daṇḍin's *Kāvyādarśa*

The plan for this repository is to collect texts and translations in the
`texts/` directory and the secondary resources in the `resources/` directory. I
will also prepare typeset notes and slides as I go through the text. I am going
to start with the second _pariccheda_ since that is the discussion of the
*alaṃkāra*s.
